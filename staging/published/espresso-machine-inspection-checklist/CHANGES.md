# Used Commercial Espresso Machine Inspection Checklist — Change Log

## 2026-09-21 — Retroactive sweep baseline (Glenerds sweep, build phase)
- Standardized the header cluster: `.g-header-actions` wrapper with More Apps pill first, icon-only dark-mode button (44x44px, moon/sun icon, dynamic aria-label/title), new icon-only sound toggle (44x44px, 🔊/🔇) at the far right; the whole cluster hides in print.
- Added the standard WebAudio sound engine (oscillator-only, no audio files, offline): click/select/success/error/toggleTheme, on by default, persisted at `espresso.sound`. Wired into theme toggle, print, reset, and checklist status changes (pass=click, flag=select, fail=error).
- Made the per-category stacked bars interactive: each category bar is a keyboard-accessible button — activating it spotlights the category and itemizes the flagged/failed inspection points with their repair ranges in a detail line; activating again restores.

## 2026-09-21 — Sample-data toggle + baseline corrections (sweep retro-fix)
- Added the icon-only "Try sample data" flask toggle as the first row of the main content area: circular 44x44px button with flask SVG, accent tint when on, muted hint line next to it, aria-label/title "Try sample data"/"Clear sample data", aria-pressed state, Enter/Space support, hidden in print. ON snapshots the current checklist and fills a realistic used 2-group inspection (two flags, one fail) that exercises the pass/flag/fail stacked bars and the repair-exposure tally; OFF restores the snapshot (user data never destroyed, sample data never persisted).
- Shared `.round-btn` class now carries the round shape for both theme and sound buttons (no ID-only shape rules).
- Hardened the sound engine: oscillator scheduling now happens after `AudioContext.resume()` resolves, so the first click always sounds.
- Sound preference key corrected to `espresso-machine-inspection-checklist.sound`.
- Added the standard bottom cross-promo ("Like this tool? Check out our other apps →" to the Gumroad store), hidden in print.

## 2026-09-21 — Sample icon locked to Glen's pick #14
- Replaced the placeholder flask SVG in the sample-data toggle with Glen's chosen icon #14 (flask with 3 bubbles), verbatim from ~/workspace/your_files/icon-final-14.svg (stroke=currentColor, 18px render size via existing CSS).
- No behavior change: snapshot/restore, aria labels, accent tint, Sound.click(), print hiding all unchanged.
